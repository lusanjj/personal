                PartB: Same webpage in Part A but using the Bootstrap framework instead.

            <li>Part C:

                <p>
                    Personally, I prefer part B. In part A, there was a lot of adjustment with different devices. It also takes a lot of time to achieve different functions. It is suitable for using HTML and CSS only in responsive website design when dealing with small amounts of varieties of devices. 
                    Otherwise, it will be not efficient in responsive website design. 
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    In part B, It is much easier. We only need to import the links of the bootstraps and other features that we need. Not only that, but also it has many features that can not be achieved with only CSS. Such as the button where the tester can open and expends it, which is attractive and readable. It would save a lot of time when we deal with big amount of breakpoints and varieties of devices

                    
                </p>
                <p>The differences bewteen these two is: Media queries are the CSS for applying different styles depends on the screen size, orientation, and other properties. Bootstrap is a style and feature framework that leverages media queries, based on the other things. </p>
