         <p style="font-size: 30px;">Hi, my name is Xin Liu. I was born on the 21th of May, 2002 in Nan Chang, China. I have been living in Canada about nearly 4 years. 
            Actually, I was not really here last two years in Toronto due to the COVID-19. I really love the lifestyle in Canada, it is chill and slow. I love the snow during winter in Toronto.
        </p>
        <aside style="font-size: 20px;">It is rarely to seed the snow in my hometown, and it is much colder than Toronto during winter time</aside>

            I study Computer Science program in <u>TMU</u> since 2020 until now. I did make some new friends during the first two year in 
            Univeristy, even though it is online study. I really enjoy build something with coding, and that makes me feel
            a sense of achivement. That is the main reason why I keep doing the major and my passion. My life goal is to try my best to study hard and get some job experience, and try to 
            intial an business tech company. I am always inspired by my father, who is an entrepreneur. I learnt many skils and field at shcool and internet.

            I love music and sports. I learnt how to play guitar and piano by self teaching. I think everyone can be
            an expert in a certain field by practice day and night. I used to play badminton with my older sister when she came back from work. 
            I also love cats. I think they are adorable and curative. WuBai always stay with me during the 
            online studies day and night.
